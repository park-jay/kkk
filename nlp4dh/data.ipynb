Stahr opened court in the\npreliminary trial of the thirteen\nmen arrested last week on the\ncharge of \"nightriding.\" This was\nnot the wording of the warrants, but\nthe case has been referred to more\ngenerally as nightriding.\n\n\nJudge F. S. Moore represented the\ndefendants, and County Attorney\nRoney and H. T. Smith, of Fulton,\nfor the commonwealth. The de-\nPENDANTS were marched in by Jailer\nMurchison and deputies and seated\nin the jury box The curious throng\nINDUCED in craning of necks to\nget a good look at a \"nightrider,\"\nafter which they fell into a silent\nstudy of the mems faces. The room\nwas packed, and remained so for\ntwo days and half, except fall\ning off in attendance was noticeable\nMonday morning.\n\n\nAfter some preliminary clashes on\npart of the counsel for each side,\nJudge Stahr ruled that he would\nhear all the cases at once, instead\nof making a separate trial of each\ncase, which was at first asked by\nAttorney Moore. This settled both\nsides announced ready. The wit\nnesses for both sides were placed un-\nder rule. A few failed to answer to\ntheir names when called and attach\nments were issued for them.\n\n\nIn brief, the arrest and trial of\nthese defendants is the elimination\nof reign of lawlessness which has\nbeen carried on to a greater or less\nextent in the lower bottom for sew\neral months. The tendency has been\nto run the negroes (tenants) out by\nthreats and intimidation. On the\nnight of Feb. 10 four houses, occu-\npied by negroes, were shot up on the\nfarms of w. c. Upton and w. J.\nHarper.

Clair, Bob Ellis, Ottie Dot\nson, Bud Dotson, Bobb Webb, Jess\nHarrison, Chas Huff, Vodie Mont\ngomery.\n\n\nIn last weeks paper the names of\nLeslie and Ernest Brice were includ-\ned in this list. They were not con-\nnected with the case, and were ex-\nonerated without trial.\n\n\nThe case, after being stubbornly\ncontested all the way through, came\nto a close Monday morning with\neloquent arguments by both Moore\nand Smith.\n\n\nJudge Stair reviewed the case\nfrom all angles and explained his\nposition from a point of law and\nnot from that of his private senti-\nnents. The evidence, he believed,\nrs governed in preliminary trials,\nvas sufficient to warrant his holding\nhe defendants, which he did.

If that plan fails after being\ntried out two days, Gov. Rye will order\nmilitary company to proceed to Tip\ntonville and place itself at the disposal\nOF Sheriff Hall.\n\n\nThis decision was reached after\nGov. Rye had conferred with Adjt.-\nGen. Charles B. Rogan. Sheriff\nHall had telephoned the Governor\nthat the situation in Lake County\nwas serious, and said that many\ncitizens were pressing him to call\nfor State troops. Gov.

Although We have\nhad no disastrous fires recently,\n1t is still a matter of fresh recol-\nlection that Hickman experienc-\ned some very costly fires; 50\nmany of them that many fire in\nsurance companies have pulled\nout of the town, and viii write\nno more business here. But IN\ndividual loss, ON account of made\nquate fire fighting facilities, is of\nmore Importance than the loss of\ninsurance companies, because a\nfew still remain in business. Hick-\nman people will average losing\nevery year as much as the fire\ntruck will cost, 80 little argu-\nment can be advanced against\nvoting a small bond issue, which\nwill repay the taxpayers its full\ncost each year-in saving proper\nty and cutting insurance pre-\nmlums down several hundred dol\nlars per annm. IL ought Ia. and\nwe believe will, be voted in a\nwhoop: Fire protection effects\nthe interest of the poorest an1\nwealthiest citizens alike. Let 5\nhave the fire department.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the city hast such an ordi-\nnance, one should be enacted\ncompelling owners of vacant lots\nTO cut the weeds. Civic pride and\ncommon deeency demand it.\n\n\n1t has been suggested by a cit\nizen of Hickman and cotton plant\ner that Hickman should have an\nopen cotton storage shed, where\ncotton might be placed in the\nbale, and held a few days. This\nwould sserye two purposes LIST,\nTO give the planter a place 10 put\nhis cotton when he takes il from\nthe gin; and 2nd, if the shed\nwould accommodate from 300 %\n800 bales, it would he an easy mat\nter 10 get buyers here 10 bid on\nsuch quantities, thus saving all\nthis shipping and storage charge.\nThis is certainly a suggestion\nworthy of consideration. The\ngentleman offering this sugges-\nton gave an example of what il\nmeans 10 have bidders on the\nground. On one occasion he had\n- bales on the river bank. He\nwrote several cotton firms, en-\nclosing samples, for a bid. The !\nbest received was Sl.c. This Of. |\nfer was turned down. Finally 4 !\nbuyer came 10 look at the cotton\nIN response 10 an invitation 10 do |\n80. He said See was the best he |\ncould do. The cotton owner re-\nfused TO discuss the matter furlh-\ner, and told the buyer he was\nholding for llhc. lie started off\nand the buyer called him back\nShip us that cotton he said.\nWith competitive buyers on the\nground. a great deal more could\nbe realized. The way 10 get\nthem here is to have a shed,\nwhere a sufficient amount could /\nbe- accumulated 10 interest the\nbuyers. A shed iOx 100 feet would\nmeet the requirements. This\ncould either be a free building or\ncould be put up by stock com\npany or individual and operated\nfor a small fee. At any rate, the\nmatter is worth investigating."

         "\n\n SAN JOSE. Cal. May 2.-An or ganization known as the Knights of Liberty, the members of which ope- rate incognito, tonight hanged H. Steinmoltz. an Oakland tailor and an alleged alien enemy, until he became unconscious. They tied him to a tree later and then took him away in an automobile. After they had hung him they took him down just as he was strangling, and he was still in semi-conscious state when taken into the automobile. An attempt on the part of bystanders to interfere with the work of the Knights resulted in a sullen order to the would-be samaritans to be about their business if they would not be visited by a similar fate.\n\n Last night the Knights tarred and feathered George Koetzer, an alleged pro-German, and then tied him to cannon in the park. They later notified the police of their work by telephone and also told the newspa- pers of what they had done. Koetzer was immediately brought to jail by the police and is to be given a fair trial on the charge, the names of available witnesses in his case hay ing been given the police.\n\n The Knights of Liberty are ope- rating absolutely in the dark. and the names of none of their members are known. That they are consider able in number is evidenced by the fact that large numbers of them ap- peared armed to the teeth when the two alleged pro-Germans were so roughly handled. California newspa- pers are comparing the organization with the Ku Klux Klan and the Ken lucky Nightriders.\n\n CAN'T BE FOUND\n\n SAN JOSE. Cal. May 2.-No trace has been found of the whereabouts of Henry Steinmoltz, a tailor of Oak land, whom the Knights of Liberty hanged until unconscious then spirit ed away in an automobile, although the county authorities have been searching for him. Nor can any of the members of the organization of Knights be identified, owing to the fact that all of them were heavily masked.\n\n It now develops that Steinmoltz and George Koetzer were tried for seditious utterances and were found guilty and fined. Koetzer was last night chained to a cannon in the park after being tarred and feath- cred, but is now in the county jail, where he voluntarily remains for his own protection With him is Her man Schmidt. another pro-German, who sought refuge there two weeks ago.\n\n Buy Liberty Bond."

The\nlegislative committee drafted bill,\nto be presented to the Missouri state\nLegislature, asking that the penalty\nfor stealing automobiles in that state\nbe fifteen years imprisonment. The\ncommittee also expressed their dis\napproval Of the parole system as it\nis now used.\n\n\nThe committee ON resolutions, with\nE. G.

Six detectives have been camping secretly for two weeks in shack on a sfamp on the farm of T. s. Heisser, a wealthy land owner and banker, against whom the night riders have centered their attacks\n\n Yesterday the hiding place of the detectives was discovered.\n\n Shortly after midnight about thirty men with one accord rose from behind as many stumps, fired volIey at the detectives shack and then dodged be- hind the stumps. These volleys con- tinued more than an hour, about 300 rounds being fired on each side. The detectives replied through improvised portholes in the shack.\n\n At about 2 o'clock the attack party began to retreat, carrying off their wounded. The detectives then ernerg- ed and a brief battle ensued, in which two of the defenders were slightly wounded."

Behind us, too, the lines of\nskirmishers, close up to us, have dis\nappeared from the face Of the earth;\nthey too, have gone to cover in the\ngrass. Only outside the firing zone\nare they still being pushed forward.\n\n\nShall we have to retreat? Are we\ngoing to attack?\n\n\nThen the order to fire rings out, and\nIs zealously passed on from unit to\nunit.\n\n\nrapid fire! Into the wood!\"\n\n\nYes, but what are we to fire at?\nLying down, there is nothing to be\nseen of the sharpshooters. They\nwon't do us any harm; in another min.\nute they will have disappeared among\nthe trees. But the machines-they\nhave hidden them away among the\nfoliage to good purpose.\n\n\nOur subaltern, lying a bare five\nPAGES away from me in the grass,\nraises himself on his elbows, and\ngazes intently through his field\nglasses. know what is vexing his\nsoul. He is handsome, splendid lad,\nfor whom even we grizzled old-timers\nwould 60 through fire and water, for\nhe meets you as man to man, with\nout shifting or swagger, as 1t becomes\nq youngster. And the other day,\nwhen l was marching with the rear\nguard, we discussed Lilliencron's nov.\nels. Since then he has always ap-\npealed to me as If he had stepped\nstraight out of one of these romances\nOf war. He is all ablaze to CLEAN\nhis first laurels. But however much\nhe may twiddle the focus of his\nglasses up and down and crane his\nneck, he cannot discover a trace of\nthe enemy, and we blaze away fool\nishly at the wood, and may, for all I\nknow, be bringing down leaves or\nhrds from the trees there.\n\n\n\"Close to the big oak. To the right\nIn the underground\" some one of the\nrank and file sings out.\n\n\nI strain my eyes to the spot, and\nfail to see anything.\n\n\nAnd again hear the guns growing\nIll round us. But somewhere out Of\nthe far distance clear, long-drawn\nbugle-call rings out amid the iron bass.\n1t thrills nerve and brain against an\niron wall.\n\n\nBehind there, to the right-they are\non the run there!

All\npossible precautions had been taken\n| against the terrorists, and the way\n| from the cathedral, through Lisbon's\n| streets, was double-banked with troops\n| while a squad of two hundred mounted\n| troopers surrounded the carriage. Sud-\ndenly the amazing thing happened.\n| The automatic rifles of the troopers\n| began to go off, as well as the rifles\n| of the double-banked infantry in the\n| immediate vicinity. In the settlement\n| the muzzles of the exploding rifles\n! were turned in all directions. The\n| slaughter was terrible-horses, troops,\nspectators, and the king and queen\nwere riddIed with bullets. To COM\nplicate the affair, in different parts of\nthe crowds behind the foot soldiers,\ntwo terrorists had bombs explode on\ntheir persons. These bombs they had\n\n\nintended to throw if they got the OPP\nportunity. But who was to know this?\nThe frightful havoc wrought by the\n\n\nbursting bombs but added to the con-\n\n\nfusion; it was considered part of the\n\n\ngeneral attack.\n\n\nAnd Emil Gluck chuckled and went\nhis way. He knew. But how was the\n\n\nworld to know? He had stumbled up\n\n\non the secret in his old electroplating\n\n\nshop on Telegraph avenue in the city\n\n\nof Oakland 1t happened, at that time,\n\n\nthat wireless telegraph station was\n\n\nestablished by the Thurston Power\n\n\ncompany close to his shop. In a short\n\n\ntime his electroplating vat was put\n\n\nout of order. The vat wiring had many\n\n\nbad joints, and, upon investigation,\n\n\nGluck discovered minute Yields at the\n\n\njoints in the wiring. These, by lower\n\n\ning the resistance, had caused an ex-\n\n\ncessive current to pass through the\n\n\nsolution, boiling\" it and spelling the\n\n\nwork But what had caused the\n\n\nwelds?' was the question in Gluck's\n\n\nmind. His reasoning was simple. Be-\n\n\nfore the establishment OF the wireless\n\n\nstation, the vat had worked well. Not\n\n\nuntil after the establishment of the\n\n\nwireless station had the vat been\n\n\nruined. Therefore, the wireless station\n\n\nhad been the cause. But how? He\n\n\nquickly answered the question. If an\n\n\nelectric discharge was capable of oper-\nating a coherer across three thousand\nmiles of ocean, then, certainly the cleo\ntrio discharge from the wireless sta\nton four hundred feet away could pro-\nduce coherer effects on the bad joints |\nin the vat wiring.\n\n\nGluck thought no more about it at |\nthe time. He merely rewired his vat |\nand went on electroplating. But after\nward, in prison, he remembered the in |\ncident, and like flash there came into |\nhis mind the full significance of it. He |\nsaw in it the silent, secret weapon with |\nwhich to revenge himself on the |\nworld. His great discovery, which |\ndied with him, was control over the |\ndirection and scope of the electric dis\ncharge. At the time, this was ne I'M\nsolved problem of wireless telegraphy |\nas it still is today-but Emil Gluck, |\nin his prison cell, mastered it. And |\nwhen he was released, he applied it.\n\n\nIt was Emil Gluck that caused the\nterrible German-American war, with\nthe loss of 100000 lives, and the con-\nof almost incalculable treas\nure. 1t will be remembered that in\n1889 strained relations existed be-\ntween the two countries. Germany,\nthough aggrieved, was not anxious for\ntnlrOT ant tha\ncrown prince and seven battleships\non a friendly visit to the United\nStates. On the night of February Is,\nthe seven warships lay at anchor in\nthe Hudson opposite New York city.\nAnd on that night, Emil Gluck, alone,\nwith all his apparatus on board, was\nout in a launch. This launch, it was\nproved, was bought by him\nfrom the Ross-Turner company, while\nmuch of the apparatus he used that\nnight had been purchased from the\nColumbia Electric works. But this\nwas not known at the time. All that\nwas known was that the seven battle\nships blew I'D, one after another, at\nregular, four-minute intervals.

         "achievement Of his WIS the assassina-\nton Of the king anG queen Of Por-\ntugal. 1t was their wedding day. All\npossible precautions had been taken\nagainst the terrorists. and the way\nfrom the cathedral, through Lisbon's\nstreets, was double banked with troops\nwhile a squad of two hundred mounted\ntroopers surrounded the carriage. Sud-\ndenly the amazing thing happened.\nThe automatic rifles of the troopers\nbegan to go off, as we'll as the rifles\nof the double-banked infantry in the\nimmediate vicinity. In the settlement\nthe muzzles Of the exploding rifles\nwere turned in all directions. The\nslaughter was terrible-horses, troops.\nspectators. and the king and queen\nwere riddled with bullets. To COM\nplicate the affair.\" in different parts of\nthe crowds behind the foot soldiers,\ntwo terrorists had bombs explode on\ntheir persons. These bombs they had\nintended to throw If they got the op-\nportunity. But who was to know this?\nThe frightful havoc wrought by the\nbursting bombs but added to the con-\nfusion; it was considered part Of the\ngeneral attack.\n\n\nAnd Emil Gluck chuckled and went\nhis way. He knew. But how was the\nworld to know? lie had stumbled up\non the secret in his old electroplating\nshop on Telegraph avenue in the city\nof Oakland. 1t happened at that time,\nthat wireless telegraph station was\nestablished by the Thurston Power\ncompany close TO his shop. In short\ntime his electroplating vat was put\ncut of order. The vat wiring had many\nbad joints, and. upon investigation,\nChuck discovered minute YIELDS at the\njoints in the wiring. These, by lower\ning the resistance. had caused an ex-\ncessive current to pass through the\nsolution, boiling\" it and spelling the\nwork. But what had caused the\nwelds?\" was the question in Gluck's\nmind. His reasoning was simple. Be-\nfore the establishment of the wireless\nstation, the vat had worked we'll. Not\nuntil after the establishment Of the\nwireless station had the vat been\nruined. Therefore, the wireless station\nhad been the cause. But how? He\nquickly answered the question. If an\nelectric discharge was capable of oper-\nating coherer across three thousand\nmiles of ocean, then, certainly the cleo\ntrio discharge from the wireless sta\nton four hundred feet away could pro-\nduce coherer effects on the bad joints\nin the vat wiring.\n\n\nChuck thought no more about 1t at\nthe time. He merely rewired his vat\nand went on electroplating. But after\nward, in prison, he remembered the in\ncident, and like flash there came into\nhis mind the full significance of it. He\nsaw in it the silent, secret weapon with\nwhich to revenge himself on the\nworld. His great discovery, which\ndied with him, was control over the\ndirection and scope Of the electric dis.\ncharge At the time, this was the un.\nsolved problem of wireless telegraphy\nas it still is today-but Emil Gluck\nin his prison cell, mastered 1t. And\nwhen he was released, he applied 1t.\n\n\nIt was Emil Gluck that caused the\nterrible German-American war, with\nthe loss of 100000 lives. and the con\nsumption of almost incalculable treas\nure. 1t will be remembered that in\n1889 strained relations existed be-\ntween the two countries. Germany\nthough aggrieved, was not anxious fol\nwar, and, as a peace token, sent the\ncrown prince and seven battleships\non a friendly visit to the United\nStates. On the night of February 49,\nthe seven warships lay at anchor in\nthe Hudson opposite New York city.\nAnd on that night, Emil Gluck, alone\nwith all his apparatus on board, was\nout in a launch. This launch, it was\nafterward proved, was bought by him\nfrom the Ross-Turner company, while\nmuch Of the apparatus he used that\nnight had been purchased from the\nColumbia Electric works. But this\nwas not known at the time. All that\nwas known was that the seven battle\n, ships blew up, one after another, at\nregular, four-minute intervals. Ninety\n! per cent of the crews and officers\nalong with the crown prince, persisted\n2 Germany believed that it had been\ndone by submarine, and Immediately\ndeclared war. 1t was six months after\nGluck's confession, that she returned\nthe Philippines and Hawaii to the\nUnited States.\n\n\nI, In the meanwhile, Emil Gluck, ma.\n, levolent wizard and arch-hater, travel.\n, ed his whirlwind path of destruction\nHe left no traces.

His method was to rent room\nor house, and secretly to install his\napparatus-which apparatus, by the\nway, he so perfected and simplified\n, that it occupied little space. After he\nhad accomplished his purpose. he care.\nfully removed the apparatus.

         "The remarkable development of the motion picture, from the first crude at tempts made only few years ago, to D. w, Griffith's celebra ted film drama, \"The Birth of a Nation\" illustrates in striking manner the possibilities of a comparatively new art. Last night at the Jefferson theatre this truly great picture was presented for the first time in Birmingham, opening an engagement of one week with daily matinees for the remainder of the week and a perform ance each night. To say that the large crowd which filled the Jefferson was deeply moved would but feebly express the power of this ma sterpiece of motion photoplay. The effect on all who saw it was tremendous. One who had seen a thousand moving pictures could not re- sist the thrilling realism of this drama The presentation lasted three hours, with only one short intermission yet every one present was held spellbound from be- ginning to end.\n\n Starting with the causes which led up to the Civil war and showing the south Tn antebellum times the drama swiftly touches upon the incident which set the smouldering fires ablaze and depicts with remarkable vividness and minutencss of detail some of the memorable events of the Civil war, in which familiar charac- ters of Thomas Dixons novels \"The Clansman' and \"The Leopard's Spots\" play their respective roles. Then the agonizing days just after the war are portrayed. sweeping on to the organiza- uon of the Ku-Klux Klan and the re- dempt1on of the south from the rule of the carpetba ggers.\n\n The battle scenes are in themselves a remarkable achievement. In numbers of men and horses taking part in the stir ring panorama of war; with it's desperate Valof, its sharp hand to- hand fighting. swift charges, artillery duels and all the sFlin realism of actual conflict there is nothlng lacking, and this part of the plcture aroused the greatest enthusiasm.

Great care was exercised to makes the historical personages as true 10 hte as possible and to make the scenes i'll Which they figure conform in every particular to the accounts of the hest authorities. It is said that the assassin- atioh or Lincoln was one of the most ulftlcult parts of The Birth of Ma loh to stage\" but the soenes as photographed will be found as nearly in accord with the actual tragedy as if was possible to make them.\n\n fefhaps the latter part of the drama makes a more lasting impression. at ieast on the southern mind.

All former members Of these\nsocieties are urged to come out and\nroot for their favorite team.\n\n\nThe second game will no doubt be\nthe best boys game played in the\nopera house this year. The high\nschool boys are working hard so that\nthey will be in condition to defeat\nthe aggressive Santa Rosa team on\nJanuary 20. The game on January\nl5 will be the last game with the\ntown boys before Santa Rosa comes\nup with the avowed intention of\nscalping the local boys.\n\n\nOn Friday evening January 20\nthere will be no picture show at the\nopera house. The entire evening\nwill be given up to basketball. The\nfirst game, Santa Rosa girls vs.. Tu-\ncumcari High School girls will begin\npromptly at 7:45. Those who saw\nthe game at Santa Rosa know that\nthis will be the hardest fought game\nof girls basketball ever played in\nTucumcari. The score at Santa\nRosa was IL to IA in favor of Tucum-\ncarl, and the local girls are deter\nmined to win the coming game by q\nwider margin.\n\n\nThe game between the Santa Rosa\nboys and Tucumcari boys will be\neven more hotly contested than the\ngirls game. It is impossible for\nteams to be more evenly matched\nthan these two teams were at Santa\nRosa. The score was tied six diff\nferent times during the game. and\nthe local boys won by a margin of\none point. The score at the end of\nthe game stood: Santa Rosa %, Tu-\ncumcari 25. Our boys are working\nhard and look forward to the coming\ngame with confidence.

This is not school\nproposition alone. The entire city\nshould be interested.

They\ncame out to see the game and. In\nfact, were tie jolly hosts to the visi-\ntors. We do not expect the mer-\nchants to discommode themselves to\nthe extent of closing their stores.\nbut we would appreciate II IL you\nwould lend US your hearty support\nand cooperate with the school to\nshow to Santa Rosa that we can en-\ntertain as royalty as they."

A presentation that has interested millions of people is still at the height of its popularity, as attested by the following from the New York Evening World of last Fri day:\n\n Contrary to the announcements made earlier in the week, The Birth of a Nation is not to leave the Liberty the atre tomorrow night. Six weeks have been added to its engagement there and nobody can tell what will come when the extension ends. This pie ture was first shown at the Liberty March 3 of this year. Its gross re- may reach $14,000. Few regular theat- rical productions in New York at pres ent are equalling these figures. To find one for the Liberty that would do as well might prove difficult\" That is always the story of The Birth of a Nation. The performance is more than an expressing entertain ment. The first part is an eloquent and impaSsioned protest against the horrors of warfare. The tragic leave takings, the wrecking of homes, the broken ties the fearful sights on the battlefield are depicted with relentless fidelity. The flower of young Amer ican manhood is shown going forth rom northern ana southern homes to certain destruction in the terrible con- f1ict which rages with appalling real ism. The calamity in Europe is brought home with sickening vivid ness.\n\n The production is valuable as les son in history, for besides the de- cisive battles of the Civil war, Lees surrender at Appomattox, Sherman's S march to the sea, President Lincoln in office and on the night of his assassi- nation and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan are among the incidents pie tured.\n\n It is the mightiest of all productions and Danielson may we'll feel gratified that it is to see and enjoy it in all af the magnitude and excellence of its Boston presentation.\n\n To avoid disappointment, however, the thoughtful ones will reserve their seats at an early hour for with only six performances to be given during the engagement, it may we'll be inn agined that there will be thousands who will not be able to secure seats for any of the performances.\n\n Late cars to Central Village and Putnam each night."
